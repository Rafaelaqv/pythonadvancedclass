    "**14-1. Describe the differences between a Figure, Axes, and Line2D object.**\n",
    "A Figure is the overall container that holds everything in a visualization, representing the page or window on which one or more graphs appear. An Axes object is a specific region inside the Figure where the actual data is drawn, including the x- and y-axes, and it represents a single graph or plot. A Line2D object represents the individual line or curve that is drawn within an Axes, based on the data values provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**14-2. What do pyplot functions subplot and subplots do and how do they differ from each other?**\n",
    "subplot and subplots create Axes object(s) within the context of a single or multipanel Figure. The subplot function creates one Axes object inside a Figure, usually specifying its position in a grid layout. In contrast, the subplots function can generate multiple Axes objects at once, arranged in rows and columns, and it returns both the Figure and the collection of Axes. In other words, subplot is used for creating one panel at a time, whereas subplots is more convenient for generating a grid of panels in a single call.\n",
    "14-3. What is the difference between normalized and data coordinates?\n",
    "Both coordinate systems are ways of describing a location in the plot frame. Normalized coordinates describe a location using a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 represents the start of an axis and 1 represents the end. They are relative to the size of the plot frame. Data coordinates, on the other hand, are tied to the actual values being plotted, ranging from the minimum to the maximum data values on the axes. For example, a value at 0.5 in normalized coordinates would mean the midpoint of the axis, but in data coordinates that same position could correspond to something like year 2010 on an axis spanning 2000–2020.\n"

For example, if we want to place multiple plots in custom position, combine different types of plots on the same axes, or adjust elements like labels, ticks, or colorbars in a detailed way. In contrast, the pyplot interface is quicker for simple plots, but the object API is better when building complext or highly customized visualizations. \n",

A filled contour plot, on the other hand, shades the spces between contour lines to highlight the ranges of values.
