    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Plot a timeseries of the annual average number of magnitude 6 (or larger) earthquakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this warmup, you will demonstrate your proficiency in using `pandas` and `matplotlib` for scientific data analysis in a Jupyter notebook.  I am intentionally not providing much guidance in this exercise, leaving it to you to determine the best path to the goal.  That said, I do have some specific instructions:\n",

    "* download [this CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taobrienlbl/advanced_earth_science_data_analysis/fall_2025_iub/content/lessons/05_multidimensional_arrays_also_plotting/data/usgs_major_earthquakes_1900-2023.csv) file containing a dataset of all earthquakes greater than magnitude 6 that USGS has on record since 1900\n",
    "* utilize Markdown cells extensively to document your thought process, including notes about the CSV file, its origin, etc.\n",
    "* comment your code extensively\n",
    "* use git to stage/commit/push this notebook to your course github repository once done (in a lesson 05 folder)\n",
    "* bonus: if you still have time, also make a plot of # of earthquakes vs month (the seasonal cycle, if there is one)\n",

    "A note about the CSV file: I obtained it from [a USGS query for magnitude 6 or larger earthquakes globally since 1900](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/?extent=-88.71618,-248.20313&extent=88.70033,336.79688&range=search&timeZone=utc&search=%7B%22name%22:%22Search%20Results%22,%22params%22:%7B%22starttime%22:%221900-01-01%2000:00:00%22,%22endtime%22:%222023-09-22%2023:59:59%22,%22minmagnitude%22:6,%22orderby%22:%22time%22%7D%7D) on Friday September 22, 2023 at 10:20am Eastern.  Though USGS ultimately was the source of the data, my search originated from an [NCEI website](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/search).  (See the markdown source of this cell for the specific URLs; the USGS query URL contains the specific query parameters.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the CSV download option provided on the website, and the file was downloaded as `query.csv`; I renamed the file to `usgs_major_earthquakes_1900-2023.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I download data like this from a web source, I'll often put it in a `data` folder somewhere and will place a `README` (or `README.md`) file in the `data` directory to give information about where I downloaded the data from and any citations that the data provider requests that I use.  I do this because I often come back to datasets like this later on and it isn't always straightforward to find this information after the fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "If you are using RED Desktop, make sure to use the `easg690_shared` kernel when running this notebook.\n",
